Welcome! Here is my project - bug tracker application that I made using .NET framework and WPF. Going by the rule to make a working product, I wanted it to be a fully functioning app.

## What is made:
- Basic WPF desktop client
- Web API that is making all data process
- Connecting to a database using Dapper
- SQL database working based on stored procedures

## What it still needs:
- More work on user interface and its features
- Adding a way to create an administrator account on the first run and other user accounts in the client by the administrator 
- Finding a way to populate issue describing tables with default values
- Adding some administrator interface for managing the app
- Visual and security tweaks on API
